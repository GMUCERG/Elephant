Notation common for all variants:

Na, Nm, Nc, Nh : the number of complete blocks of associated data, plaintext, ciphertext, and hash message, respectively
Ina, Inm, Inc, Inh : binary variables equal to 1 if the last block of the respective data type is incomplete, and 0 otherwise
Bla, Blm, Blc, and Blh : the number of bytes in the incomplete block of associated data, plaintext, ciphertext, and hash message, respectively


NOTE: All variants use the same test vectors
Primary difference in variants is that the rounds per cycle of spogent
permutation are unrolled
Valid values for rounds per cycle are 1, 4, 5, and 8.
Set PERM_ROUNDS_PER_CYCLE in elephant_constants.vhd as desired.

a. Design goal
   V1 Full datapath 1 cycle 1 round supports AEAD Encrypt/Decrypt
   Basic iterative full datapath width
   1) < 2000 LUTs
   2) No BRAMS
   3) no DSP units
b. Supported maximum size of inputs: Support for all message sizes
c. Reference software implementation:
   crypto_aead/elephant160v1/ref/
        With bug fixes present on published Git repo
               https://github.com/TimBeyne/Elephant
d. Non-default values of generics and constants: None
e.  Block sizes:
    AD Block size = M Block size = CT Block size = 160 bits
f.  Execution times
    There is no difference between full blocks and incomplete blocks.
    This is due to the shifting that occurs while processing the input.
    Execution time of authenticated encryption:
        87+((8+80)*(Na+4))+(8+160)*Nm)+2
    Execution time of authenticated decryption:
        87+((8+80)*(Na+4))+(8+160)*Nc)+2

    Permutation time:
        80
H)
    latency of authenticated encryption
    259+256=515
    latency of authenticated decryption
    259+256=515
I)
    Execution time of authenticated encryption:
        4+((8+80)*(Na+4))+(8+160)*Nm)+2
    Execution time of authenticated decryption:
        4+((8+80)*(Na+4))+(8+160)*Nc)+2
    Key setup time: Loading a new key
        7 + 80
    Key reset time: Loading a saved key
        4
J) No Change

A) V5 Full datapath 1 cycle 5 round perm supports AEAD Encrypt/Decrypt
B) Unrolled permutation
   Maximum throughput assuming 2000 or less LUTs
   no BRAMs and no DSP units
C) Support for all message sizes
D)  crypto_aead/elephant160v1/ref/
        With bug fixes present on published Git repo
               https://github.com/TimBeyne/Elephant
E) N/A
F) AD Block size = M Block size = CT Block size = 160 bits
G)  
    There is no difference between full blocks and incomplete blocks.
    This is due to the shifting that occurs while processing the input.
    Execution time of authenticated encryption:
        23+((8+16)*(Na+4))+((8+32)*Nm)+2
    Execution time of authenticated decryption:
        23+((8+16)*(Na+4))+((8+32)*Nc)+2

    Key setup time: Loading a new key
        7 + 16
    Key reset time: Loading a saved key
        4
    Permutation time:
        16
H)
    latency of authenticated encryption
    28+40=68
    latency of authenticated decryption
    28+40=68
I)  New key vs same key     Difference
    23          4        =  19
    Execution time of authenticated encryption:
        4+((8+16)*(Na+4))+((8+32)*Nm)+2
    Execution time of authenticated decryption:
        4+((8+16)*(Na+4))+((8+32)*Nc)+2
J) No Change
