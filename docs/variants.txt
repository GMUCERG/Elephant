Notation common for all variants:

Na, Nm, Nc, Nh : the number of complete blocks of associated data, plaintext, ciphertext, and hash message, respectively
Ina, Inm, Inc, Inh : binary variables equal to 1 if the last block of the respective data type is incomplete, and 0 otherwise
Bla, Blm, Blc, and Blh : the number of bytes in the incomplete block of associated data, plaintext, ciphertext, and hash message, respectively


NOTE: All variants use the same test vectors
Primary difference in variants is that the rounds per cycle of spogent
permutation are unrolled
Valid values for rounds per cycle are 1, 4, 5, and 8.
Set PERM_ROUNDS_PER_CYCLE in elephant_constants.vhd as desired.
